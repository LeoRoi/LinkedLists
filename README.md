# LinkedLists
self-made singly/doubly linked list with generics &amp; some basic methods + search

singly linked list with student-objects*: 
  - compose new elements
  - add to the head V tail
  - print one V all elements
  - print the element number
  - delete one V all elements
  - search by attributes
  - sort by attributes
* student-object attributs are: first name, last name, student number and degree program

doubly linked list has not all those funktions; it is about how to access elements differently from SLL
