# LinkedLists
self-made singly/doubly linked list with generics &amp; some basic methods + search

singly linked list (SLL) with student-objects <br/>
student-object attributes are: first name, last name, student number and degree program <br/>
it is possible to:
  - compose new elements
  - add them to the head V tail
  - print one V all elements
  - print the element number
  - delete one V all elements
  - search by attributes
  - sort by attributes (buble & selection sort)

doubly linked list has not all those funktions; it is about how to access elements differently from SLL
